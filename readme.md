# Some sort of general overview title goes here
Here's where I talk about what I'm doing and why
1. revamp personal site
1. build some sort of presence on github
1. tinker with new frameworks as they become interesting
1. etc. and such

# Setup Stuff
## there isn't any right now, so this is a useless subheading

# Technology Overview
## initial version
+ plain stuff for a static site: html5, css3, javascript
+ likely have everything hosted on AWS, although some later versions might plop down over the top of my existing site
## second rev
+ Have a backend, probably .NET Core or Ruby on Rails, either of them with Postgres as the datastore.
